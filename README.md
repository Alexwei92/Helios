Helios is a C++ API for 3D physical simulation of plant and environmental systems. In order to build and compile the core library, you will need to install a c/c++ compiler (recommended are the GNU c compilers version 5.5+), and CMake. In order to run many of the model plug-ins, you will need to install NVIDIA CUDA 9.0+, and a GPU with compute capability 3.0+. The software has been tested on Linux and Mac platforms, and compatability with Windows machines is unknown at this point.
